while).

** Install VirtualBox (if you haven't already)

Download the latest version from the [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox Downloads]] pages:
- Windows users can use the version for a [[https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.10/VirtualBox-6.0.10-132072-Win.exe][Windows host]].
