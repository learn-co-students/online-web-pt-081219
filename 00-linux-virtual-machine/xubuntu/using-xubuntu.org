3. Select the amount of memory to give your VM. XUbuntu requires *at
   least* 512 MB of memory, but the more it has, the better it can run.
   At the same time though you don't want to give it too much or your
   host system won't have enough. Generally, you don't want to give it
   more than 1/4 of your total memory:
