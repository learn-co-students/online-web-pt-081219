* Sinatra REST, MVC, and Forms
** CRUD
- CREATE
- READ
- UPDATE
- DELETE
** REST
Way of thinking about how users will interact with your website from
the outside

- Not thinking about classes (or Ruby)
- What is client doing to do

Standard way for clients to communicate to a server what they want to
have happen

- HTTP
  - VERB (what to do)
  - Route (where to do it)

| CRUD   | VERB      | ROUTE          | ACTION                             |
|--------+-----------+----------------+------------------------------------|
| CREATE | POST      | /comments      | create new comment                 |
| READ   | GET       | /comments      | read all comments                  |
| READ   | GET       | / comments/:id | read the comment with id = :id     |
| UPDATE | PATCH/PUT | / comments/:id | change an already existing comment |
| DELETE | DELETE    | / comments/:id | delete the comment with id = :id   |

GET /videos /1012 => id = 1012
PATH /users / 3029 => update user 3029

** MVC (Ruby)
- Models (ActiveRecord) => Representing specific parts of our Domain
- Views (HTML) => What the user actually sees
- Contoller => What brings it all together (listen for specific REST
  actions and call ActiveRecord methods)
